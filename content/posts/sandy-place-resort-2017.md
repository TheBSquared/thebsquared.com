We are always excited when it's time to venture off for a holiday. We normally take off with a caravan in tow. This time we were using the parent's RCI points to stay somewhere a little less rustic. 

<!--more-->

We opted to stay at Sandy Place Resort, in St. Lucia. We've been here before and loved it. This time was no different. What was different, however, was two kids with us. Our own of course. We're not creepy. Last time it was just B and I. This time, add Kyle and Ayla, 3 and a bit, and 11 weeks respectively. And my mom-in-law. I'll start with a review as a parent.

## If you're a parent...

Depending on where you're located in the resort, this is a parents' dream. We were located adjacent to the kids play area (which seemed new). We pretty much had no 3 year old for most of a day. Which was both relaxing and nerve wracking. He's not _quite_ ready to be left alone, he is only 3, but since he was playing pretty much outside the back door, we left him. He loved it. We appreciated the space from a pre schooler for a little bit. I actually read a book for the first time in weeks. I may have also had a snooze on the couch. The last time that happened was just over a year ago. Although I'm sure my wife will remind me that that's a lie. The play area consists of a trampoline, jungle gym, game room, kids entertainment room, and outdoor chess and noughts and crosses. Plus some space to ride a bike along pavements. There's not a great deal of space for kids to ride though, so be careful of other visitors. There are signs all around to remind us that little ones may be on the loose.

## The Facilities

You'll arrive to pretty much a fully stocked unit. If you brought no cooking utensils, or pots, you'll do just fine. If you like your coffee, you'll need to bring a French press or some other coffee maker. 

Towels are supplied, as are other basic toiletries. Bring toothbrushes and the like. 

There is air conditioning all around, so no matter the weather, you can stay comfortable. 

### Kitchen

The kitchen is well stocked, complete with an oven and four plate stove. You could bake here. All glasses, plates, cups and cutlery are included. There's even a wine bottle opener. Handy for those, well, bottles of wine. 

You also get a fridge with freezer, and a full deep freeze. I believe that this is used extensively by the fishing frenzied amongst you. I don't fish, so it's great to know you can have an extended stay with frozen meat available for just about any length of stay.

### The Braai

There's a built in braai that does the job. Nothing fancy here. It's not protected from rain, so wet days will find you either in the kitchen, or a local restaurant (more about these shortly).

### Bedrooms

Well thought out, good cabinets, and reasonable beds adorn. Two single sleepers and a double bed in our unit (plus two sleeper couches). But, if there's a severe flaw in these units, it's the mattress[^1]. It's bordering on awful. It's the **only** place I've stayed where the bed comfort was actually a serious issue. Two sleepless nights, and I eventually slept on the sleeper couch. The sleeper couches only work if you're reasonably short (5'6” or less I would guess; I was a little cramped at 5'8”).

## Restaurants

Nearby you'll find [plenty of eateries](https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/Restaurants-g312636-St_Lucia_KwaZulu_Natal.html). Even out of season the options are adequate. For the fine diners amongst us? You're in the wrong town. As I say, they're adequate.

However, there is a [little surprise nearby](https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/Restaurant_Review-g312636-d3464420-Reviews-Fishermans_Restaurant_Pub-St_Lucia_KwaZulu_Natal.html). If you love your seafood, then head across the road, and in to a rather rough looking fish place. Its entrance is almost in the garage (just to the left of it). You'll enter what is essentially a sports bar style restaurant, but the seafood is to die for. Do confirm if the line fish is available before you order, as they sell out early. If there's no line fish, then don't underestimate the hake. It's still exquisite. As are the calamari, mussels, and prawns (although slightly over done, but it was a takeaway this time). Reviews on Trip Advisor are all over the map, but generally they refer to poor service, and/or location. I can't entirely fault them, but the food has always been good when we've been.

Other eateries look good enough, and there are a few staples such as [John Dory's](https://www.johndorys.co.za), [Ocean Basket](https://oceanbasket.com) and [Braza](http://www.brazasa.co.za). There's even a [Kauai](http://www.kauai.co.za). There's [an Italian place next door](http://www.amazululodge.com) that gets mixed reviews; I think it's entirely based on the owner's mood on the day. We have never been there.

There's also a [lovely little coffee shop](https://www.facebook.com/Thyme-Square-Coffee-Gift-Shop-236352646399059/) on the lower floor of the same center as John Dory's (to the right). We've had great coffee there in the past, and it still seems to be going well.

## Local Activities

It's St. Lucia, so fishing is a thing here. So is whale watching. As well as estuary cruises. Hippo and crocodile live here (the former have been spotted going through town). There's a crocodile farm up the road. It's not as good as the one in Scottburgh, but it's worth a visit. It sadly does feel a little neglected, and the tea room is generally poorly stocked and often unstaffed unless you ask for assistance at the shop. It's a pity, as it could be a great place to have a bite to eat.

The [Western Shores Park](https://isimangaliso.com/jewel/western-shores-and-charters-creek/) is another great option, entrance is Duduka Gate (about 2kms out of town, heading along the R618). This was a good day's outing. We arrived at 10:30, and explored until 16:30. The facilities here are clean, and there are ablutions at most of the stops. The picnic site is delightful, but bring everything as there are no chairs or tables. 

There's a boardwalk a few kilometres further along. Do not miss it as the views from here are breathtaking.

## Back to the resort, service

We were greeted by friendly smiles, and front desk was on the ball. We had a deep freeze that didn't seem to be doing it's one task, and this was swapped out the next morning (we only noticed in the evening). 

We accidentally broke a toilet seat cover, which we reported, and that was replaced sometime while we were out. Thankfully we were not charged in this case, apparently the current ones are flimsy and are being replaced along the way.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, I highly recommend this place. Awful mattress aside (I'm writing that off to our specific one) the unit is well worth it.

[^1]: I could have reported the mattress and it may have been replaced. To be honest, it didn't cross my mind. I normally assume that the mattress quality is a standard feature.
